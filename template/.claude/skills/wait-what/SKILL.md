description: >-
  Re-pitch the last reply that did not land: lead with the conclusion, then the context it
  assumed, in plain sentences and the project's own words, without simplifying the substance.
  Where the miss was a gap in knowledge rather than a dense delivery, offer once, briefly, to
  open a lesson on it. Invoke by typing /wait-what, or when <%AUTHOR_FIRST_NAME%> says 'wait,
  what?', 'I didn't follow that', 'say that again more simply', 'what does that mean?' or 'you
  lost me'. Never invoked by the model on its own. Not for learning a skill over several
  sessions (`teach`), and not for sharpening an undecided design (`grilling`).

# Skill: Wait-what (<%PROJECT_NAME%>)

The previous reply failed. Not the work behind it: the **explanation**. Re-pitch it.

Locale: en_GB · <%TIMEZONE%> · dates DD/MM/YYYY.

## Governing procedures (route here — do not restate at length)

**None.** This is a conversational mechanic, not a step in any workflow; it gates nothing, and
the one artefact it can lead to is written by `handoff`, not here. It is the counterpart of the
grilling rule that a vague answer is restated precisely: here the author is telling the model
that its answer was the vague one. The project's own words, which a re-pitch must use, are in
`standards/style/terminology.md`.

## What went wrong (assume one of these)

- **Missing context.** The reply began three steps in, from a premise never stated.
- **Unshared vocabulary.** It used a term this project has not defined, or a defined term
  loosely.
- **Too dense.** Correct, and unreadable.
- **Buried answer.** The reasoning arrived before the conclusion.

## Steps

1. **Lead with the conclusion.** One sentence the author could repeat to someone else.
   *Complete when:* the re-pitch opens with that sentence.
2. **Give the context it assumed.** What was already true before this started, and why it
   matters, before any detail. *Complete when:* nothing in the re-pitch rests on a premise it
   does not state.
3. **Write simple, direct sentences in the project's own words.** One idea each, active voice,
   short words over precise but obscure ones; a long word that is load-bearing stays and is
   defined inline, once. Use the terms in `standards/style/terminology.md` and the names the
   project's files use; a synonym invented on the spot is what caused the miss. *Complete when:*
   every term is either the project's own or defined where it first appears.
4. **Keep the substance whole.** The claim, the trade-off and the caveats survive intact; only
   the delivery changes. Name the step most likely to have missed, and expand that one hardest.
   *Complete when:* nothing the original reply asserted has been dropped or softened, and the
   likely gap is named.
5. **Offer a lesson only for a knowledge gap, after the re-pitch.** Too dense and buried answer
   are delivery failures: the re-pitch is the whole fix, and the turn ends. Missing context and
   unshared vocabulary are knowledge gaps: after the re-pitch, in two lines at most, name the
   topic as a kebab-case slug (the `learning/<topic>/` folder `teach` would use), say whether that
   folder already exists (resume it) or not (the first lesson creates it), name the opening
   lesson (the concept that just missed), and offer the route: a teaching-detour handoff, then a
   new session that runs `teach`. Ask once per topic per session; if declined, drop it.
   *Complete when:* the turn ends after the re-pitch, or after one short offer for a knowledge
   gap.

## Rules

- **Do not repeat the original wording.** If it had landed, this skill would not have been
  invoked; saying it louder is the failure.
- **Do not apologise, and do not narrate the correction.** Re-pitch and move on.
- **Stay scannable.** A re-pitch is licence to spend the words differently, not to write an
  essay.
- **The teaching-detour handoff is `handoff`'s to write**, in full, with the descriptor
  `HANDOFF-TEACH-<TOPIC>-DD-MM-YYYY.md`, a `Teaching detour` line (the topic, the concept that
  missed, the opening lesson) and `teach` first among the next skills.

## Anti-patterns

- **Simplifying the substance** to make it land. An explanation that lands by being wrong is
  worse than one that missed.
- **Offering a lesson before the re-pitch**, or more than once. It reads as a deflection.
- **Inventing a new term** to explain an old one.
